      <p className="disTxt">At Ksham Innovation, we break down barriers and make technology accessible to everyone.</p>
      <p className="disTxt">We believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to hear, speak, and navigate the world in real-time, regardless of people with hearing, speech or visual impairment.</p>
      <p className="disTxt">Our technology is designed to empower those with disabilities, allowing them to learn, communicate & perform their daily chores with greater ease and independence.</p>
      <p className="disTxt">But our work doesn't stop there. We dream & envision to create a smart and safer alternative to traditional earbuds and headphones, extending the age during which people may face difficulties in hearing.</p>
      <p className="disTxt">By doing so, we are not only improving the lives of those with hearing loss, but also providing a solution for anyone who wants to enjoy music, information access or audio content without the risk of damaging their hearing.</p>
